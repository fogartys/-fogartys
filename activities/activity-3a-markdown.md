It's good, but it takes a lot to make it. Also, I love _Star Trek_; it's superior in **every** way to _Star Wars_.

I will eat anything from a replicator. Don't `@` me.

### Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 2 tbsp milk
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/4 cup basil
* 1/2 tsp chervil
* 1/2 tsp chives
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 1/2 tsp tarragon
* 1/4 cup onion
* 1 sausage
* 1/4 cup spinach
* 2 button mushrooms
* 1/4 cup cheddar

### Directions

1. Place 1 tablespoon butter in saucepan.
2. Add the sausage slices to the pan and cook until satisfactorily browned (about 6 minutes each side). Set aside.
3. Add the mushrooms and spinach to the pan, and cook until the leaves are somewhat wilted. Set aside.
4. In a small bowl, beat eggs until frothy.
5. Add milk, half of basil, chervil, chives, turmeric, tarragon, pepper, and salt to eggs and mix well.
6. Place remaining butter in pan.
7. Spoon egg mixture into pan over melted butter.
8. Using a spatula, flip over egg when the underside has cooked (examine the edges or roll the pan about to determine if the underside has cooked).
9. Once the egg has cooked on both sides, top half of the egg with cheese, onion, sausage slices, mushrooms, and spinach.
10. Fold the other half of the egg over the filling, and press down gently with the spatula without spilling toppings into the pan.
11. Use the spatula to carefully transfer the omelet to a serving dish, and top with remaining fresh basil.
12. Serve hot with orange juice or coffee.
