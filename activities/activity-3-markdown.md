## Markdown tidbits

Before we get started here, I invite you to meet Professor Bonham-Carter, who provides an overview of Markdown in the video below:

## Double, double toil and trouble

---

There's no long or short of it: I'm hungry and I'm not feeling particularly creative. I need you to help me with both parts of that. I want a recipe for something tasty to make.

That's your job. Mine was to tell you that I am hungry.

So, what does that mean for you?

In [3a_week-0-worksheet-markdown.md](3a_week-0-worksheet-markdown.md), I'd like you to type a recipe which:

1. Uses _only one_ (1) level-one heading (`#`)
2. Uses _at least two_ (2) level-two headings (`##`)
3. Uses _at least two_ (2) lists (`*`)
4. Contains _at least one_ (1) paragraph describing the recipe (make it appealing, somehow)
5. Contains at least one image (see instructions below regarding images)

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

        <b>Tip:</b> In the <b>.md</b> file, right click and select "Show Markdown Preview" to open a live side-by-side preview of what your markdown will actually look like! 
    </p>
</div>

For an additional level of practice, right-click this text and select `Show Markdown Editor` to see what my Markdown looks like!
  
### Images

In this activity, there are two ways to incorporate images. One is to use a direct URL, for example:

```
![Ulysses On Fleek](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/dluman/cmpsc100/img/ulysses-2.jpeg)
```

Another way is to _upload_ an image to your `activities` folder using the `Upload` button. It's easy to miss, but the Jupyter project offers very short video on where to find it (click below to watch):

[![The Upload Button](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/1bd2QHqQSH4/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bd2QHqQSH4?rel=0)

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
    <p>
        Make sure that the file browser (to the left) is in the folder you intend to put the image! (For this activitiy, the <strong>activities</strong> folder.)
    </p>
</div>

If I were to place `ulysses-2.jpeg` in this folder (I did), I'd use the following markdown to display him:

```
![Ulysses is always in style](ulysses-2.jpeg)
```

## Finishing this activity

---

We'll verify that this activity is complete during [5_week-0-worksheet-github-push](5_week-0-worksheet-github-push.ipynb) activity. I'll test the relative quality and appeal of the outcome of the recipe later. That's, as we might say, subject to _taste_.

(If you can't tell already, I have the jokes.)
